# Changelog

# [NEXT]

Generated tool calls classify Neon API 4xx responses by their `kind` and HTTP status even when `@neon/tools` and the server load different `@neon/sdk` versions, returning the API error to the MCP client without reporting it as a server failure.

OAuth dynamic client registration normalizes scalar and mixed `redirect_uris` values to a string array before storage. Authorization applies the same normalization to existing client records without changing which redirect URI schemes are accepted.

Scheduled function triggers (`list_triggers`, `get_trigger`, `create_trigger`, `update_trigger`, `delete_trigger`) under `?category=functions`, and branch credentials (`list_credentials`, `create_credential`, `revoke_credential`, `rotate_credential`) under `?category=branches`. Requires `@neon/tools` 1.3.0. `credentials.reveal` is not a tool.

`clientApplication` on analytics events now classifies Devin, Perplexity, Hermes Agent, and Grok connector sessions. `grok-cli` stays `grok-build`.

When the MCP handshake or User-Agent does not name a product (`node`, `undici`), `clientApplication` on analytics events falls back to the OAuth client's registered name.

List, register, and delete branch custom domains: `list_functions_custom_domains`, `register_functions_custom_domain`, `delete_functions_custom_domain` (`?category=functions`). Requires `@neon/tools` 1.2.0.

Management API tools now come from `@neon/tools` 1.0.0. Hosts select SDK method paths (`projects.list`); the package default is already verb-first (`list_projects`). This server still overrides historical and singular names (`describe_project`, `create_project`, `create_branch`, `reset_from_parent`, `compare_database_schema`, `provision_neon_auth`, `provision_neon_data_api`, `list_branch_computes`). `create_project` and `create_branch` call `projects.create` / `branches.create` (compute on by default, no connection string). Operation-backed writes wait. Raw Management API operations, `operations.waitFor`, `createAndConnect` tools, JWKS, VPC, anonymization, masking, org-member reads, and project member/permission writes are not tools. Host tools stay for SQL, inspect, migrations, query tuning, docs, search, `list_organizations`, `get_connection_string`, and redacted `get_neon_auth_config`. Every tool argument is `snake_case` (`project_id`, `database_name`, `sql_statements`), including host tools. Unknown camelCase aliases fail schema validation. Project-aware tools publish the same optional `project_id` field across grants, with instructions suitable for hosts that cache schemas. Unscoped calls still require an explicit ID at full handler validation. Scoped calls inject an omitted ID from the grant, accept a matching explicit ID, and reject a conflicting ID before invoking the handler. URL grant query params stay camelCase (`?projectId=`, `?category=`, `?readonly=`). New `?category=` values: `functions`, `storage`, `endpoints`, `snapshots`. `?category=branches` includes role and database tools and no longer includes compute-endpoint tools (`?category=endpoints`). A token already issued for `branches` gains those role and database writes. Unknown `?category=` values are ignored and named on initialize notices. `limit` on a list tool caps how many items come back.

A GET snapshot of a standard email provider reports `password` as `***redacted***` when the API returns an empty string.

`inspect_database`: omitting `database_name` now covers every database on the branch (same contract as `neon inspect db` 3.4.0). Database-scoped checks add a `database` column; compute-wide checks run once against the first listed database. One failing database fails the whole run.

OAuth refresh-token chain stability — drove the reconstructed refresh-grant SLO from ~93% to 100% in production by closing the cross-instance reuse race and the surrounding cliff/retry-storm paths.

Refresh-token reliability:

- Singleflight intra-instance dedup: when N concurrent requests arrive on the same Vercel container with the same refresh token, only one forwards to Hydra and the others wait for the shared result, instead of all racing upstream.
- Add a Redis-backed distributed lock around refresh-token rotation so two serverless instances handling the same refresh token no longer both forward to Hydra, which would detect token reuse and revoke the entire chain.
- Extend the cross-instance success cache to 7 days and write it before persisting the rotated tokens; subsequent retries that arrive while persistence is in flight (or after persistence has failed) replay the cached result instead of presenting an already-rotated token upstream.
- Cache upstream 4xx responses for 10 minutes and capture structured upstream-error details, so retry storms from a single client short-circuit at our layer instead of forwarding hundreds of redundant calls to Hydra.
- Cache pre-upstream failure paths (refresh token not found, access token not found, client mismatch) so concurrent waiters resolve to a clean `400 invalid_grant` instead of timing out the lock with a `503`.
- Retry the rotated-token persist phase and degrade to the success cache when the KV write keeps failing, so clients always pick up the new pair instead of presenting a now-dead refresh token.
- Retry the upstream `/oauth2/token` exchange on network-layer failures (`ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `EPIPE`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETUNREACH`, `UND_ERR_SOCKET`); HTTP 4xx/5xx are intentionally not retried because Hydra may have already rotated.
- Reject upstream responses missing `refresh_token` with `502` and apply a logged 1-hour floor when `expires_in` is missing, instead of minting already-expired tokens.
- Close a lock-waiter micro-race where a holder finishing between the waiter's two polls left the waiter blind to the just-written cache, causing spurious `503`s.
- Release the refresh lock and the transient-failure marker in a single atomic Lua eval. Previously the two were separate Redis SETs; on Upstash HA Redis a waiter's reads could land on different replicas and see the lock-release before the marker, falling through to a 5-second `transient_lock_timeout` instead of bailing fast as `transient_upstream_5xx`. The 2026-05-08 07:17 UTC Hydra burst exposed this with 12/12 cascaded lock-timeouts; the atomic release removes the replication window.
- Cap each upstream `/oauth2/token` attempt at 4.5 seconds. Production data shows Hydra 5xx is bimodal — fast (<200ms) or slow (4.5–37s, holding the connection open). Without a cap, slow responses caused the lock holder to outlive the waiter's poll budget; the waiter timed out as `transient_lock_timeout` (counts BAD) instead of bailing as `transient_upstream_5xx` (excluded). The cap is non-retryable (server-side outcome unknown) and routes through the same atomic Lua release-with-marker path so concurrent waiters bail fast.
- Bump the lock-waiter poll budget from ~5s to ~8s (`LOCK_POLL_MAX_ATTEMPTS` 50 → 80). Sized to absorb the 4.5s upstream cap plus the holder's release + transient-marker write plus a ~3s margin for poll granularity and Redis RTT, so the holder's release always lands before the waiter gives up.
- Make refresh locks resilient to vanished holders. The lock TTL is now short (6s, refreshed by a heartbeat while the holder is alive) so a Vercel function killed mid-flight by the platform (OOM, container shutdown, host eviction) doesn't keep waiters blocked for the previous 30 seconds. When a waiter sees the lock disappear without a cached result, it performs a single takeover attempt: `SET NX` onto the freed key and run `executeRefresh` itself. The takeover cap (one attempt) keeps upstream calls bounded at N+1 where N = number of vanished holders; concurrent waiters race the takeover via `SET NX` so `executeRefresh` still runs at most once per token. The 2026-05-08 07:17 UTC burst (12 cascaded `transient_lock_timeout` events with no accompanying upstream 5xx) was the canonical case for this pattern.
- Forward the upstream OAuth error code (e.g. `token_inactive`, `invalid_client`, `invalid_request`, `invalid_grant`) into the `[SLO] refresh outcome=cliff_upstream …` log line as `upstreamOauthError=<code>`. Lets cliff bursts be classified by upstream cause via a single grep pipeline instead of cross-correlating with the sibling `Upstream refresh token exchange failed` lines.
- Stop deleting the stored refresh token when the upstream rotation returned the same token value (no-op rotations no longer poison the KV between cache write and persist).
- Reinitialize the OAuth Keyv (Postgres) store when connection errors indicate a poisoned pool, so credential rotation or terminated connections no longer break every request until the serverless container recycles.

Auth correctness:

- Issue `*` on OAuth tokens when the client requested it and write was granted. `scopes_supported` is `read` and `write`; `*` remains an alias, not an advertised scope. Callback uses the per-flow authorize state for token scope instead of the client-keyed KV row.
- Stop embedding MCP-specific grant context (scope categories, read-only mode, project-id scoping) in the upstream OAuth `state` parameter; the Neon console OAuth backend doesn't understand those scopes and shouldn't see them. Grant context is now resolved from the saved client registration, OAuth resource URI, or MCP URL query params.
- MCP-specific configuration moved from custom `X-Neon-*` headers to URL query parameters where appropriate, simplifying client wiring (the legacy `x-read-only` header still works).
- Pass tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) through `registerTool` to the MCP response — they were defined but not actually surfaced to clients.

Observability:

- Emit a structured `[SLO] refresh outcome=<bucket> elapsedMs=<n> clientId=<id> ...` log line at every refresh-grant exit point. Buckets: `success`, `correct_invalid_grant`, `cliff_upstream`, `transient_lock_timeout`, `transient_persist_failure`, `transient_upstream_5xx`, `transient_upstream_network`, `bad_request`. The new `transient_upstream_network` bucket separates network-layer failures from HTTP 5xx so the diagnostic vector is preserved even though both are excluded from the SLO denominator.

Tool authorization:

- `get_connection_string` now requires write access. The connection string carries a privileged role password, so a read-only caller could use it to connect directly and write. Read-only tool count drops from 23 to 22, and the read-only notice now points users at the Neon Console for a `DATABASE_URL`.
- Remove the read-replica selection this tool applied in read-only mode. It rewrote the URI's hostname while leaving the credentials untouched, so it never restricted what the string could be used for. Internal callers such as `run_sql` and `inspect_database` are unaffected.

Transport security:

- Bind SSE sessions to the caller identity that opened them. Previously any caller who knew or guessed a live `sessionId` could `POST /api/message` and inject responses into the victim's SSE stream; the binding key is hashed and stored in Redis alongside the existing session record.
- Bind the SSE session-identity to the OAuth `client_id` instead of the bearer token. Hourly token refreshes (handled cleanly by the refresh-chain fixes above) used to rotate the bearer and so flip the identity hash, which caused the next `POST /api/message` to return a `403 session_not_owned` — Cursor's MCP client interpreted that as an auth failure and prompted the user to re-authenticate. `client_id` is stable across token rotations for a given registered MCP client, so the binding now survives refreshes; cross-account and cross-OAuth-client POSTs still mismatch as before.
- Relay upstream OAuth error redirects from `/callback` to the originating MCP client per RFC 6749 §4.1.2.1. Previously when upstream Hydra redirected to `/callback?error=…&state=…` (no `code`), the route returned a generic `400 {"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"Missing code or state"}` and the user was stranded on a Neon page. Now the `error`, `error_description`, `error_uri` and the client's original `state` are forwarded to the registered `redirect_uri` so Cursor / ChatGPT / Claude can present a meaningful retry UI on their own side. The well-known Hydra fingerprint `error=error&error_description=The error is unrecognizable` is preserved and tracked separately as `upstream_unmapped_error` in the auth-callback SLO so it's visible in dashboards instead of being conflated with user-driven cancels.
- Add an auth-flow SLO at `/callback` — `[SLO] auth-callback outcome=<bucket> elapsedMs=<n> ...` emitted at every exit point, mirroring the refresh SLO at `/api/token`. Buckets: `success`, `correct_user_denied`, `upstream_unmapped_error`, `upstream_5xx`, `upstream_other_error`, `state_decode_failed`, `bad_request`, `internal_error`. See `ai-notes/auth-callback-slo.md` for the definition and targets.
- Fix `lib/errors.ts` constant typo that silently suppressed structured upstream-error handling. The handler compared against `'RESPONSE_BODY_ERROR'` while oauth4webapi's actual constant is `'OAUTH_RESPONSE_BODY_ERROR'`, so every conforming OAuth error body from upstream (status 400 + JSON `{error, error_description}`) fell through to the generic `500 server_error` path instead of being relayed as a `400` with the upstream message. Also adds handling for `OAUTH_RESPONSE_IS_NOT_CONFORM` (upstream returned an unexpected HTTP status — e.g. Hydra 500 with non-JSON body): now returns `502 upstream_error` with the upstream status included in the description, instead of a generic `500`.

# [1.0.0]

- Existing clients remain compatible, with new options to scope access by project and capability categories.
- Added support for grant-aware tool filtering via `X-Neon-*` headers, including read-only mode controls.
- Added `/api/list-tools` so clients can preview exactly which tools are available for a given scope/read-only configuration.
- OAuth authorization now preserves and applies client registration context, including read-only defaults, for more predictable permissions UX.
